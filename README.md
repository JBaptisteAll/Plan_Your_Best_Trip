# **Weather Insights for Your Next Adventure** üåç

## **Introduction**
Planning a trip can be tricky without the right data. This project aims to simplify that process by analyzing **weather forecasts for the next five days** across 35 destinations. With real-time **GPS data** and advanced **weather analytics**, this project provides clear insights into weather conditions to help users make informed travel decisions.

This project demonstrates expertise in **data acquisition**, **API integration**, and **data visualization**. By leveraging real-time datasets and advanced analytical techniques, I developed a solution to **analyze** and **visualize** weather trends effectively, delivering actionable insights for better decision-making.

## **Problem Statement** üßê

When planning a trip, 70% of users express a desire for more detailed and reliable information about their travel destinations. However, they often face several challenges:

- **Trust issues**: Many users struggle with trusting information from unfamiliar sources.
- **Data overload**: The overwhelming amount of unstructured information online makes it difficult to identify actionable insights.
- **Fragmented tools**: Most travel platforms do not integrate real-time weather insights, leaving users with incomplete data.
- **Accuracy concerns**: Inconsistent or outdated weather data often leads to uncertainty, making it harder for users to plan effectively.

This highlights the need for a data-driven solution that consolidates reliable weather information, empowering users to make informed decisions with confidence.

## **Methodology** üöÄ
1. **GPS Data Collection**:

2. **Weather Data Integration**:
   - Weather forecasts for the next five days were retrieved using the API of [OpenWeatherMap](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast).  
   - The API responses, formatted as JSON, were processed and structured into a DataFrame for analysis.

   - A new column, **Average Temperature**, was calculated for each row as the mean of the minimum and maximum temperatures.  

```python
df_meteo["Temp_Avg"] = (df_meteo["Temp_Max"] + df_meteo["Temp_Min"]) / 2
```

   - The data included:  
     - **Temperature** (minimum, maximum, and calculated average values).  
     - **Humidity** (indicating the comfort level of the weather).  
     - **Weather Descriptions** (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow).  

   - A custom **Weather Score** was calculated to rank the destinations based on their favorability. This score was derived using the following rules:  
     - Clear skies and warm temperatures contributed positively to the score.  
     - Rainy or snowy conditions reduced the score, with heavier precipitation having a greater negative impact.  
     - Extreme weather conditions, such as storms, were heavily penalized.  
     - The formula incorporated weighted averages of temperature, humidity, and weather conditions to provide a holistic assessment of weather favorability.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - The data was cleaned and structured into a unified DataFrame for easier interpretation.

   - Destinations were ranked and compared based on:
     - Average temperature.
     - Weather score trends over five days.
     - Anomalies like extreme weather conditions.

### **Interactive Weather Map**
This project features an **animated density map** that visualizes temperature averages across destinations over five days. 

Below is a preview of the interactive map:
```python
df_meteo["Latitude"] = pd.to_numeric(df_meteo["Latitude"], errors="coerce")
df_meteo["Longitude"] = pd.to_numeric(df_meteo["Longitude"], errors="coerce")

df_meteo_pos = df_meteo[df_meteo["Weather_Score"] >= 0]
```
```python
fig = px.density_mapbox(
    df_meteo_pos,
    lat="Latitude",
    lon="Longitude",
    z="Temp_Avg",
    mapbox_style="open-street-map",
    animation_frame="Date",
    zoom=3.5,
    radius=10,
    center={"lat": 46.603354, "lon": 1.888334}
)

fig.show()
```
